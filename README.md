Master Splitter

This script was created in order to prepare texts for linking to dictionary entries. The corresponding JS code (not in an open repo') would select items wrapped in span tags and search their dictionary definitions. In addition, the sentences would be analyzed with Contextors' "perfect parser" to yield its full syntactic analysis.
